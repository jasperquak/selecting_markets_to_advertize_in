# Selecting markets to advertize in

Based on around 20,000 replies to a survey amongst young coding professionals, in this study, we will analyze which would be interesting markets to advertize in for an (imagenary) eLearning platform. 

This project was a 'guided project' as part of learning data analytics with [Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io).

## Results

To display the result, simply [click the .ipynb file](https://github.com/jasperquak/selecting_markets_to_advertize_in/blob/main/FindingBestMarketsAdvertize.ipynb) in this repository. It will open in a Notebook viewer.

## Reproduction

In case you want to reproduce the project in a Jupyter Notebook in your own environment.

Download both the .ipynb file and the .zip file. Unpack the .zip file and make sure that all .csv files are in the same folder as the .ipynb file.

Before starting Jupyter Notebook, ensure that you have the following packages installed:
* pandas
* matplotlib.pyplot
* seaborn

## About the data sources

The data was extracted published by [FreeCodeCamp on Github](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey).
